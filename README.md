# AdventOfCode
This project holds my solutions for various years of Advent of Code.
This repository is only intended for personal use/sharing solutions with others,
and therefore includes my input files. To run this on your own input, simply
replace the file in the proper YEAR/input folder and run.

## Usage
Run the program, follow the prompts.
There is also a "profiler" included which can be accessed by entering "profile" at the year/day prompt.
This simply runs all implemented days and times them.
